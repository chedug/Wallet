	Plan
+ Write TransactionSerializer
+ TransactionList view (/wallets/transactions/) Return all transactions for current user
+ TransactionDetail view (/wallets/transaction/<transaction_id>) Get transaction detail
+ TransactionListWalletName (/wallets/transaction/<wallet_name>) Get all transaction where wallet was sender or receiver



Requirements:
1) User register, login, logout
2) Logic, described above
3) Every feature in a new branch. Merge the new branch to master after approval
4) Try to follow architecture principles (SOLID, DRY...)
5) Use pre-commit hooks. Example: https://towardsdatascience.com/4-pre-commit-plugins-to-automate-code-reviewing-and-formatting-in-python-c80c6d2e9f5
6) Use annotations
7) Write unit tests
8) Prepare a ReadMe file. The file describes what needs to be done to start the project.

	Hints:
use @transaction.atomic decorator for writing transaction logic
